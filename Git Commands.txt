 Step 1 : $ git int

=> init command creates a new Git repository. 
It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository.

Step 2 : $ git status

=> The git status command is used to show the status of the git repository.
This command displays the state of the local directory and the staging area.

Step 3 : $ git add .

=> The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. 
It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. 
However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant wayâ€”changes 
are not actually recorded until you run git commit.

Step 4 : $git commit -m " Message want to Display"

=> The git commit command is one of the core primary functions of Git. 
Prior use of the git add command is required to select the changes that will be staged for the next commit.
Then git commit is used to create a snapshot of the staged changes along a timeline of a Git projects history.

Step 5 : $git push -u origin main

=> The git push --force -u origin command uploads content from a local repository to a remote repository.
Normally, Git only allows changes to be pushed if the commit history of your local branch is up to date with the remote repository branch.
